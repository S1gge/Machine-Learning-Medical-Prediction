# ðŸ§  Disease Prediction with Machine Learning
This project is part of a machine learning lab focused on cardiovascular disease prediction. Using a public dataset from Kaggle, the goal is to explore, clean, and model data to accurately classify individuals as having or not having heart disease.

ðŸ©º Task Summary
Dataset: Cardiovascular Disease Dataset on Kaggle

EDA: Visualize distributions (age, weight, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)

Feature Engineering:

Create BMI and blood pressure category features

Remove outliers based on domain knowledge

Modeling:

Compare 3â€“5 machine learning models

Use feature standardization/normalization

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Evaluation:

Classification reports and confusion matrices

Final ensemble using VotingClassifier

ðŸ“Š Goal
Build and evaluate models that predict the presence of cardiovascular disease, and explore which features contribute most to prediction performance.
